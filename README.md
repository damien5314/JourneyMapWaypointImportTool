# JourneyMapWaypointImportTool
Java app that imports waypoints from Xaero's Minimap to JourneyMap (mods for Minecraft).

## Usage
Download the JAR from the [releases page](https://github.com/damien5314/JourneyMapWaypointImportTool/releases)

TODO: Add command usage example

## Currently supported imports
- Xaero's Minimap (1.12.2) to JourneyMap (1.12.2)

## Contributing
PRs are welcome for enhancements to this tool. Support is currently limited to a very specific use case that I initially needed when writing the tool, but it should be fairly easy to adapt the code for other mods and mod versions if needed.
